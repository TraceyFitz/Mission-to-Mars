# Mission-to-Mars

Using the folowing webscraping Methods to extract Mars data such as Chrome Developer Tools to identify HTML components of the Nasa data we would like to use. Beautiful Soup and Splinter will automate the scrape of data. Mongo, a non SQL databse, will store our messy data. And finally using Flask to display the data on our own website.
